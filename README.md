# Module IIM Back-end Web Development
## Continuous Assessment 2 
## Student: Nathalie Flores - Id: 21520
## Lecturer: George Blanaru

## Assignment Description  
Develop a full stack web application using Node.js, MongoDb, Express and React(or similar interface)
that can perform CRUD operations. You are free to choose the type of data the application will store
(e.g. users, cars, animals, etc.). The data should be complex enough, containing different types of
values (Strings, ints, Booleans, etc.). You can reuse the code for CA1 for your server-side code

## Additional Information 
[40%] All CRUD operations are working as intended.
[10%] The application is connecting to the right database using Atlas. The link is pointing towards
your database.
[10%] The data is complex: it contains at least one index (unique entry); has at least 3 types of
variables and there are sufficient entries already in the database;
[10%] Code is readable: consistency, right indentation, comments.
[20%] The application is accompanied by a short report (max. 500 words) or a ReadMe file. The
report should explain the developing process of the application.
[10%] Creativity: Do your own research and add any other functionality to your application (e.g.
multiple variable types – image, booleaan, array, json array, etc.; CSS styling - bootstrap,
search/filtering button, log-in system)

## Running the Project
1. To use this run: 
- npm init (to initialize your Node.Js project).<br>
- npm install express (to install express for routes).<br>
- npm install mongoose (to install the mongodb database driver).<br>
- npm install bodyparser (to be able to use multiple http requests).<br>
- npm install –g nodemon (restarts the application when you save the document).<br>
2. Works with Postman localhost: 3000

## Project Summary


### Initial Ideas


### Contextualizing
Book as a class. <br>
Title, author, ISBN, yearPublication and publishingHouse as characteristics of the object.

## Development Process. 
1. Clone my previous project (It was the base of the back-end)
2. Created my base of the front-end with the command npx create-react-app

### Libraries 
1. Express
2. BodyParser
3. Mongoose
4. React App
