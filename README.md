# Module IIM Back-end Web Development
## Continuous Assessment 2 
## Student: Nathalie Flores - Id: 21520
## Lecturer: George Blanaru

## Assignment Description  
Develop a full stack web application using Node.js, MongoDb, Express and React(or similar interface)
that can perform CRUD operations. You are free to choose the type of data the application will store
(e.g. users, cars, animals, etc.). The data should be complex enough, containing different types of
values (Strings, ints, Booleans, etc.). You can reuse the code for CA1 for your server-side code

## Additional Information 
- [40%] All CRUD operations are working as intended.
- [10%] The application is connecting to the right database using Atlas. The link is pointing towards
your database.
- [10%] The data is complex: it contains at least one index (unique entry); has at least 3 types of
variables and there are sufficient entries already in the database;
- [10%] Code is readable: consistency, right indentation, comments.
- [20%] The application is accompanied by a short report (max. 500 words) or a ReadMe file. The
report should explain the developing process of the application.
- [10%] Creativity: Do your own research and add any other functionality to your application (e.g.
multiple variable types – image, booleaan, array, json array, etc.; CSS styling - bootstrap,
search/filtering button, log-in system)

## Running the Project
1. To use this run: 
- npm init (to initialize your Node.Js project).<br>
- npm install express (to install express for routes).<br>
- npm install mongoose (to install the mongodb database driver).<br>
- npm install bodyparser (to be able to use multiple http requests).<br>
- npm install –g nodemon (restarts the application when you save the document).<br>
2. Works also with Postman localhost: 3000

## Project Summary
The main idea of doing this project is to learn MERN. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. Where MongoDB is a database, express is the web frameworks of Node.js (Javascript) and React is the client-side JavaScript framework. 

### Initial Ideas
I thought it was simple. However, an amount of time is required to create the correct connection to the database. The proper use of importing libraries helps to make the configuration between components easily. 

### Contextualizing
Book as a class. <br>
Title, author, ISBN, yearPublication and publishingHouse as characteristics of the object.

## Development Process. 
1. Clone my previous project (It was the base of the back-end)
2. Created my base of the front-end with the command npx create-react-app.
3. Created components
4. Install npm react-router-dom and use routes
5. Install axios and review config. 

### Libraries 
1. Express
2. BodyParser
3. Mongoose
4. React App
5. React-router-dom
6. Axios

### References and adaptation explanations

## Testing
* Example of succesfully connection with MongoDB:

* The React app page was blank. -.- Failed to find the error. The job has all the required parts of the project and I don't even have any errors in the console. I can not understand why the information is not displayed.


## Considerations
I learned a lot about MERN. With this project to try to find the error, follow complete tutorials. Each person has their way of working and that leads to their way of programming. Many separate the server part with the client part and others do not. Better to divide and organize folders for better issue tracking. I have to do more practices related to this topic in order to improve my skills.

## GDPR
The code was based in the coding propose explain during the clases<br>
